![Me](https://github.com/vejsili/vejsili/blob/main/images/image_002_PAF.jpg)
Let me introduce myself :airplane: I graduated from the **Universit√† degli Studi di Padova** in **Aerospace Engineering**. My objective is to have a career in same field as I am fascinated by aeronautics and space missions.

In depth, I want to contribute to the next generation of aircraft and aero engines.
I am proud to have started this path through relevant projects:

* **First job experience**: _Clean Sky 2 "Fly-By-Wire for Small Air Transport (SAT)"_ at **TXT e-tech** as a consultant for **Piaggio Aerospace**, in Villanova d'Albenga, Italy
* **M.Sc. Thesis**: _Design of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) for Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBPR) turbofan engine_
* _Aerodynamic multi-objective optimization of NACA 65-(12)10 profile used in axial compressor_
* **Other projects**: 
    * _6-DoF aircraft simulator in MATLAB Simulink_
    * _LES simulation of a turbulent channel in OpenFOAM_
    * _Numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations - incompressible, 2D flow, staggered Finite Difference (FD) in FORTRAN_
    * _A simplified computation of ISS Docking from Molnija Orbit, with the support of GMAT_

Those previous experiences came to a successfull end, now I am eager to deepen my knowledge, expertise and competences in the Aerospace field by sailing new routes, encounter brilliant colleagues, and being tested in unexplored environments.  <img src="https://github.com/vejsili/vejsili/blob/main/gif/gif_002_NewRoutes.gif"  width=50 >
