Let me introduce myself :airplane: I am Eng. Mirsad Vejsili, graduated from the **Universit√† degli Studi di Padova** in **Aerospace Engineering**, with *Aeronautical curriculum*. My objective is to have a career in Aerospace. I am fascinated by aeronautics and space missions.

I am happy to have started this path through relevant projects and the Master Thesis at the Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, and even with my first job experience:

* M.Sc. Thesis on the design of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) for Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBPR) turbofan
* First job experience on the Clean Sky 2 "Small Air Transport (SAT)" framework at TXT e-tech as a consultant for Piaggio Aerospace, in Villanova d'Albenga, Italy

By the way, :arrow_heading_down: that's me :grin:

Let me say Riviera Ligure is extremely beatiful, and I am happy to have spent time in there.


My first interests are propulsion and flight physics, but in general Aeronautics and Space fields. I want to contribute to the next generation of aircraft engines and vehicles, and I am proud to have started this path through the M.Sc. Thesis and my first industrial job experience at Piaggio Aerospace, where I had also assisted activities on engine test rigs.
The master thesis was on the design of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) for Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBPR) turbofan engine, from scratch. The baseline of the engine was a real baseline of UHBPR turbofan, given by one of the major aircraft engine designer and manufacturers in the world.

Those 2 main experiences came to a successfull end, now I am eager to deepen my knowledge, expertise and competences in Aerospace by sailing new routes, encounter new people, being tested in new environments.
