I am Eng. Mirsad Vejsili. The 7th March I graduated from the Universit√† degli Studi di Padova in Aerospace Engineering, with Aeronautical curriculum. I work at TXT e-tech. In 2023 I was engaged as a consultant for Piaggio Aerospace. The project ended successfully last December. You can find some article and posts on my LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirsad-vejsili-563538199 , available in both Italian and English languages.

My first interests are propulsion and flight physics. I want to contribute to the next generation of aircraft engines and vehicles, and I am proud to have started this path through the M.Sc. Thesis and my first industrial job experience at Piaggio Aerospace, where I had also assisted activities on engine test rigs.
The master thesis was on the design of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) for Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBPR) turbofan engine, from scratch. The baseline of the engine was the real baseline of a UHBPR turbofan given by one of the major aircraft engine designer and manufacturers in the world.

Now, I am ready to tackle new challenges.
