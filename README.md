# Mirsad VEJSILI - Aerospace Engineer / focus on Aircraft Propulsion, Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics

![Me](https://github.com/vejsili/vejsili/blob/main/images/image_002_PAF.jpg)
I graduated from the **Università degli Studi di Padova** in **Aerospace Engineering**. My primary objective is to have a dynamic role that involves direct engagement with vehicles, experts, and pilots, and to contribute to the next generation of aircraft and aero engines—a path I am proud to have started through relevant projects:

* **M.Sc. Thesis**: _Design of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) for Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBPR) turbofan engine_
* **First job experience**: _Clean Sky 2 "Fly-By-Wire for Small Air Transport (SAT)"_ as a **TXT e-tech** consultant for **Piaggio Aerospace**, in Villanova d'Albenga, Italy
* [_Aerodynamic Multi-Objective Optimization of a NACA 65-(12)10 Stator Cascade in an Axial Compressor_](https://github.com/vejsili/voyager/blob/main/docs/Vejsili_Mirsad_Project_MAOM_rev4_Open.pdf)
* **Other projects**: 
    * _6-DoF aircraft simulator in MATLAB Simulink_
    * _LES simulation of a turbulent channel in OpenFOAM_
    * _Numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations - incompressible, 2D flow, staggered Finite Difference (FD) in FORTRAN_
    * _A simplified computation of ISS Docking from Molnija Orbit, with the support of GMAT_

Those previous experiences came to a successfull end, and today my commitment is dedicated to the embedded software development of the M346 Mission Computer (MC) at LEONARDO Aircraft Division, at the headquarter of Venegono Superiore (VA), Italy.
