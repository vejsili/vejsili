Let me introduce myself :airplane: I am Eng. Mirsad Vejsili, graduated from the **Università degli Studi di Padova** in **Aerospace Engineering**, with *Aeronautical curriculum*. My objective is to have a career in Aerospace as I am fascinated by aeronautics and space missions.

I want to contribute to the next generation of aircraft engines and vehicles.
I am proud to have started this path through relevant projects and the Master Thesis at the Università degli Studi di Padova, and even with my first job experience:

* **M.Sc. Thesis**: _Design of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) for Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBPR) turbofan_
* **First job experience**: _Clean Sky 2 "Fly-By-Wire for Small Air Transport (SAT)"_ at **TXT e-tech** as a consultant for **Piaggio Aerospace**, in Villanova d'Albenga, Italy

By the way, :arrow_heading_down: that's me :grin:

Let me say Riviera Ligure is extremely beatiful, and I am happy to have spent time in there.

Those 2 main experiences came to a successfull end, now I am eager to deepen my knowledge, expertise and competences in Aerospace by sailing new routes, encounter new people, being tested in new environments.
