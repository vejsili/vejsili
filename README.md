I am Eng. Mirsad Vejsili, graduated from the **Universit√† degli Studi di Padova** in **Aerospace Engineering**, with*Aeronautical curriculum*. I work at TXT e-tech and was engaged as a consultant for Piaggio Aerospace until the end of 2023 when the project I was working on ended successfully. You can find some article and posts on my LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirsad-vejsili-563538199, available in both Italian and English languages. Otherwise, check Piaggio Aerospace's posts.

I am enthusiast to share a piece of the company's noticeboard on the image above. Instead below, that's me :grin:

Let me say, Riviera Ligure is extremely beatiful, and I am happy to have spent time in there.


My first interests are propulsion and flight physics, but in general Aeronautics and Space fields. I want to contribute to the next generation of aircraft engines and vehicles, and I am proud to have started this path through the M.Sc. Thesis and my first industrial job experience at Piaggio Aerospace, where I had also assisted activities on engine test rigs.
The master thesis was on the design of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) for Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBPR) turbofan engine, from scratch. The baseline of the engine was a real baseline of UHBPR turbofan, given by one of the major aircraft engine designer and manufacturers in the world.

Those 2 main experiences came to a successfull end, now I am eager to deepen my knowledge, expertise and competences in Aerospace by sailing new routes, encounter new people, being tested in new environments.
